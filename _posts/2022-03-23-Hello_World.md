# Hello, World!

"Hello, world!" - the trailhead of every programmer's journey and likewise now
the start of my blogging journey.

Today, I am kicking off a reboot of my first blog and I am hoping that I will 
be more successful.  The first time that I tried blogging, I used Ghost, nginx,
and a Digital Ocean droplet. That cost me about ~$100 annually.  Today, I'm 
setting up a Github page for my blog.  This way, it only costs me about $30 per
year because I have a custom domain.  I am building static sites with Sphinx
and ablog.  This makes my operating cost less, but I don't get any server-side
functionality.  I'll start here and then move on to bigger and better things if
I stick with it.

Let's finish this first post with a little introduction.  If you can't tell by
the domain name or the logos present throughout the blog, my name is Kevin
McFarland.  I am a software quality engineer who focuses on testing and
validation of firmware that goes into Apple Mac products.  My role consists of
a whole lot of Python, bash, and various infrastructure frameworks like Ansible
with a little bit of reading and reviewing C, C++, Objective C code.  That is
probably all I can say about that and this blog WILL NOT be about my work.  I
plan on including Python posts here, but all of the problems presented will be
things found on the internet from places like FreeCodeCamp, Project Euler, etc.

Before assuming my position here at Apple, I worked as a Xeon server
post-silicon validation engineer at Intel where I had worked for six years.
I was focused on post-silicon validation for my tenure at Intel.  When I
started in Columbia, SC, I was focused on PCIE validation within commercial
operating systems(OSes) like Xen, Red Hat, Windows, Ubuntu, Fedora, etc.
In that role, I focused mostly on getting comfortable debugging in our 
python environment and learning the ins-and-outs of Linux and Windows. 
Then I transitioned to the automation team where I was able to learn
a lot more about the whole process of our validation. As part of this
team, I developed many infrastructure automation scripts and I got very
comfortable working within our SQL databases that stored and managed tests.
Finally, I worked within a team of brilliant developers working on
enabling the validation of projects with our synthetic, internal Linux
distribution and I focused mainly on enabling and validating virtualization of
IO resources (a.k.a VT-d).

On my free time, I enjoy spending time with my wonderful, handsome baby boys,
Wesley and William and/or my beautiful wife, Brittany. We definitely spend a good bit of
time binging content on Netflix and Amazon Prime Video, but I am also a huge 
DIY/tinker-nut and I perform the vast majority of maintenance on our home and
our vehicles. I also enjoy anything where I get to work with my hands like
woodworking. I have also been known to assist and take over my wife's crafts.

-Thank you, 

Kevin McFarland
