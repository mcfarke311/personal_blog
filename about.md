# About Me

## TL;DR 
Hello, my name is Kevin! I’m a software developer who is passionate about Python. I believe that coding should be accessible by everyone and that anyone should be able to codify their thoughts. I love spreading knowledge, sharing what I know, and being an agent for cultural change. I have received several awards and recognitions for efforts in automation and driving efficiency and I have been trained and certified as a Lean Six Sigma Yellow Belt. I hold a Bachelor’s of Science degree in Computer Engineering from Clemson University.
